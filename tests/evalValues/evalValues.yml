# Basic values to reference
one: 200
two: 500
three: 999
four: 1111
five: 200

# Simple boolean evaluations
boolean: ${eval(100 > 500)}
booleanTrue: ${eval(500 > 100)}

# Inner variable references with self
booleanValue: ${eval(${self:three} > ${self:four})}
booleanValue2: ${eval(${self:one} > ${self:two})}
booleanValue3: ${eval(${one} === ${five})}

# Arithmetic operations
addition: ${eval(10 + 5)}
subtraction: ${eval(20 - 8)}
multiplication: ${eval(6 * 7)}
division: ${eval(20 / 4)}

# Arithmetic with inner variables
additionWithVars: ${eval(${self:one} + ${self:two})}
subtractionWithVars: ${eval(${self:four} - ${self:three})}
multiplicationWithVars: ${eval(${self:one} * 2)}
divisionWithVars: ${eval(${self:four} / ${self:five})}

# Comparison operations
greaterThan: ${eval(${self:two} > ${self:one})}
lessThan: ${eval(${self:one} < ${self:two})}
equality: ${eval(${self:one} == ${self:five})}
inequality: ${eval(${self:three} != ${self:four})}

# Complex expressions
complexExpression: ${eval((${self:one} + ${self:two}) > ${self:three})}
complexExpression2: ${eval(${self:one} * 2 == ${self:two} - 100)}
complexExpression3: ${eval((${self:four} - ${self:three}) > 100)}

# Edge cases
zeroComparison: ${eval(0 == 0)}
negativeNumbers: ${eval(-5 < 0)}
stringEquality: ${eval("hello" == "hello")}
